         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The TESTIMONY of <hi>Lydia Hills</hi> concerning her wonderful Cure, and Re≈øtoration from Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and Pains extraordinary.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE God and Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt knoweth, that I lie not;</hi> but do deliberately utter the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth,</hi> and in ≈øerious Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>Account</hi> I mu≈øt ≈øhortly make to the great Judg, for all that I <hi>≈øpeak</hi> and <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am about 40 Years of Age. By a Fall near 22 Years ago, I received a Brui≈øe in my right Hip, (which had been before di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected) cau≈øing a great Lamene≈øs. For the Removal whereof, about 17 Years ago I was taken into St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s <hi>Ho≈øpital</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> under the Care of Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. After Means u≈øed about two Years, I was di≈ømi≈ø≈øed; being as well as it was thought, that by the Surgeon's Art I could be made; though at that Time I could not go without two Hand-crutches. Upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151664:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->of Pains recurring, I was taken into the ≈øaid <hi>Ho≈øpital</hi> two ≈øeveral times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But came forth, ≈øtill, Lame and in Pain. In the Revolution of a few Years, I was under the Hands of another Surgeon named Mr. <hi>Ma≈øchal,</hi> of or about <hi>Southwark.</hi> Who al≈øo left me Pained and Lame, after much Torture given me.</p>
            <p>Pained and Lame al≈øo I continued for ≈øeveral Years; though no Surgeon was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for my Relief, till about three Years ago, Mr. <hi>Tomp≈øon</hi> of <hi>Fanchurch-≈øtreet, London,</hi> was employed for my Help under extream and extraordinary Pains. Who, as the former Surgeon had done, opened the Wound to the Bone; declaring the Bone to be foul, as the former Surgeon had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And, as the former, told me there was no Hope of a Cure; nor was ought to be expected but a Mitigation of Pains.</p>
            <p>From that Time I have been in continual Pain, more or le≈øs, and oft-times violent; but never able to go without Crutches, and oft unable to ≈øtir with them. About ≈øix Years al≈øo a Shaking Pal≈øy hath afflicted my Head; and till lately, was growing on me.</p>
            <p>Never felt I any con≈øiderable Change for the better, until <hi>the</hi> 17th <hi>Day of</hi> November la≈øt pa≈øt. Upon which Day, about 9 or 10 of the Clock in the Morning, after <hi>Reading</hi> God's holy Word, and <hi>Praying</hi> to God, and

               <hi>a ≈øecond time Reading</hi> his Word, I found upon a ≈øudden a wonderful Ea≈øe and Strength given to me.</p>
            <p>The Scripture which I read the ≈øecond time, was, that, (which opening the Bible did light to my Eye) <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Je≈øus ≈øaid to her, O Woman, great is thy Faith: Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt. And her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was made whole from that very Hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having begged the Holy Gho≈øt to enable me, I did act Faith ≈øo, as I could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do. And, as ≈øoon as my Doubts were vanqui≈øhed, my Pains and my Weakne≈øs were removed. Upon trial made, I found my ≈øelf able to walk with much Ea≈øe, as to the Day of the Date hereof I do continue. The <hi>Fi≈øtula,</hi> which I had in my Hip, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, much about 18 Years, from that time abated, and is now dried up. In≈øomuch, that through the wondrous Mercy of God, I am ble≈øs'd with ≈øuch Ea≈øe and Strength, as I had been many Years far from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of.</p>
            <p>Through his ble≈ø≈øed Grace, I have above twenty Years ≈øince devoted my ≈øelf unto him, to be his, according to my <hi>holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈ømal Covenant.</hi> And have waited on him, under the Mini≈øtry of Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burge≈øs,</hi> ≈øucce≈ø≈øively. In≈øomuch, that I hope there will not be wanting tho≈øe, who will vouch for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of this my Te≈øtimony.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151664:4"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->
            <p>I add, therefore, this only: That by the wonderful Cures reported in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> and <hi>Morefields,</hi> I was awakened, and put upon the Exerci≈øe of Faith afore≈øaid. But I had great Doubts, which very long held about me. And, before the Removal of them, as to the very <hi>Time of my Cure,</hi> I had not, that I know of, any Amendment.</p>
